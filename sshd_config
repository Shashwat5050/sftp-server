# Internal SFTP subsystem with additional options
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -d /data -u 000

# NOTE
# -d : start_directory
# Specifies an alternate starting directory for users. The pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime: %% is replaced by a literal '%', %d is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated, and %u is replaced by the username of that user. The default is to use the user's home directory. This option is useful in conjunction with the sshd_config(5) ChrootDirectory option.

# -u : unmask
# Sets an explicit umask(2) to be applied to newly-created files and directories, instead of the user's default mask.
# We have used 000 so that all the users can access each other's files and directories.
